Simulation and training the model:
simulated 100 populations
each comprised of 300 individuals
genotyped at 10,000 sites (SNPs)
which 100 are associated with the trait with equal effect on the trait
The minor allele frequency was set to 5% 
rate of missing data to 3%
number of epochs (e.g. 500),
fixed number of 100 SNPs that are expected to be associated with the trait.

Testing GWANN with real data:
The SAM population is comprised of 287 individuals
used a publicly available data of approximately 600,000 SNPs
maximum missing data rate of 30%
